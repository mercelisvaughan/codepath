# codepath
COSC 338 Group Project

Scrum is a type of software development that helps teams organize, plan, and review work for upcoming sprints. This proposal comes from an experience of being in unorganized scrum meetings/business environments where the team was not on the same page. The problem this project will solve is the problem of group members going into different directions in projects.
	Conceptually to complete this project, we need to allow communication through apps(like how people can post to the codepath discussion board), UI for the different classes, and classes to complete the functionality of the backend.
	The product experience will leave the user with an understanding of what they and their teammates need to complete and see each other’s progress. It will include real time updates and push notifications. The value of the app to the user is clear, friends and peers can greatly benefit from this app, students complete group projects and start businesses frequently. The market for this app is huge, everyday people are coming together with their ideas and this application can help them keep track perfectly and look at the data logged. This app will be used regularly by users in work environments to see updates on the team and their progress. The objective of the application is clear, help teams keep track of progress in a work environment. I’d like for more features to be added as time progresses. This app will be a challenging application to complete, we will be implementing features from Parse and other applications.
